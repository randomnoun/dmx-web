Channel definitions.

<p>A channel definition (ChannelDef) describes the functionality of one (or more)
DMX channels for a lighting fixture.

<p>There should be sufficient information within a ChannelDef to
create the user interface for a DMX control representing that channel. 

<p>Converting channel values to fixture output, though, is performed
by ChannelMuxers.
